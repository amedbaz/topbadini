 "akurti":"Hekla, active volcano, southern Iceland, lying within the country’s East Volcanic Zone. It is Iceland’s most active and best-known volcano. The volcano is characterized by a 3.4-mile- (5.5-km-) long fissure called Heklugjá, which is active along its entire length during major eruptions. Lava flows issuing from this fissure have contributed to the volcano’s elongated shape. Hekla stands 4,892 feet (1,491 metres) above sea level 70 miles (110 km) east of Reykjavík, the capital, at the eastern end of the island’s most extensive farming region.",

 "akurti":"Snow cover has a significant effect on climate and on plant, animal, and human life. By increasing the reflection of solar radiation and interfering with the conduction of heat from the ground, it induces a cold climate. The low heat conduction protects small plants from the effects of the lowest winter temperatures; on the other hand, the late disappearance of snow in the spring delays the growth of plants. When snow melts in the spring, the resulting runoff feeds rivers and supplies water for irrigation and other human enterprises. Heavy snowfalls can severely hinder transporation in variable moderate climates but provides a firm surface for travel in remote Arctic, Antarctic, and mountainous areas, using traditional dogsleds or snowshoes or modern snowmobiles.",

Volcanic islands of a different sort are those of the two great arcs: the Lesser Antilles and the South Sandwich Islands. Partly continental and partly oceanic are the Greater Antilles in the Caribbean and South Georgia and the South Orkney Islands in the Scotia Sea. Purely continental are the British Isles, Newfoundland, the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas), and Greenland, which is an extension of the Canadian Shield.",
